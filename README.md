## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS 😃

### What I learned

I put to practice most of the concepts I've learned in SCSS, especially the @use and @forward and the 7 - 1 pattern!

Got to style component, utility and layout before writing the HTML markup, which was quite fun, the thought process made me feel like a real dev. 😎
